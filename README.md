###Connect 4 Game vs. Minimax AI

# Your typical connect four game but with a little twist!

Instead of the single connect four board, you have four boards instead.
A player may pick a single board and place a coin within that chosen board.
A random coin will drop in the other three boards that the player did not choose.
This twist applies to the AI as well, but the AI will always play the most optimal 
move looking at all four boards.
